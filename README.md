# GradCAM-Pytorch-vs-Keras-insights-
This project implements and compares Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (GradCAM) using both PyTorch and TensorFlow frameworks. It provides a side-by-side visualization of how these frameworks interpret and highlight important regions in images using ResNet50.
