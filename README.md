# Battle of the Frameworks: PyTorch vs Keras in Computer Vision
An Evidence-Based Analysis Using GradCAM Visualizations
## Overview
This project dives into a comparative experiment between PyTorch and Keras/TensorFlow implementations of GradCAM visualizations using the ResNet50 architecture. The experiment highlights key differences in their behavior and capabilities, providing insights for AI practitioners to select the best framework for their needs.

## Experiment Details
- **Objective**: Compare GradCAM visualizations generated by PyTorch and Keras to understand framework-specific behaviors.
- **Test Images**: Wildlife, sports, and objects for diverse and robust comparison.
- **Frameworks Used**: PyTorch, Keras (TensorFlow backend).

## Key Discoveries

### 1. Gradient Handling
- **PyTorch**: Broader, more distributed activation maps.
- **Keras**: Focused, concentrated feature highlights.
- **Impact**: PyTorch may be better at detecting subtle features, while Keras excels in pinpointing dominant ones.

### 2. Feature Emphasis
- **PyTorch**: Consistent full-object coverage.
- **Keras**: Precise feature targeting.
- **Use Case**: Use PyTorch for broad context and Keras for specific feature detection.
